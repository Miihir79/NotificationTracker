An app that helps keep track of your notifications

### About the app
Ever swiped away a notification mindlessly and then never found out what it was? Well, that's how I ended up creating this app.

Never miss a notification again with Notigication Tracker app. This app has features like:

- List of 10 most recent notifications on home screen
- List of all notification
- List of app wise notification
- Search feature to find that missed notification!
- Get the message if even if the sender deletes it
